# Slices

Experimental interface for presenting a small photo project I've been working on.

Although built using Svelte and powered by three.js, every element on the screen has a corresponding DOM node and may be selected, copied, or saved.

The goal was mainly aesthetical, but I also wanted to explore ways to present image fragments like those collected during my project.

I've been taking photographs and extracting 1000x707px fragments where I deemed fit. I focused on areas with vivid colors, patterns, or details. I find these fragments visually engaging, especially when presented together. This small project allowed me to use these fragments, or slices, both as abstract swatches of color and texture (the 3D shapes) and as complete images, worthy of a closer look (the interface overlay).
